# GAtomic
A C# molecular geometry game inspired by ![KAtomic](https://github.com/KDE/katomic)

Developped originally using ![SharpDevelop](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop)

You can even design new molecular formulas (set GAtomicFormulaEditorForm.cs as the Startup form) and new games based on new or existing formulas (set GAtomicGameEditorForm as the Startup form)
